To represent a 1D object in 2D space, there is only one equation that needs to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_{0}, A_{1})\]
in 2D space lies on the 1D object defined by the point(s)
\[(\alpha_{0,0}, \alpha_{0,1}), (\alpha_{1,0}, \alpha_{1,1})\] which all lie on that 1D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[-1.00000000000000
= 0\]
