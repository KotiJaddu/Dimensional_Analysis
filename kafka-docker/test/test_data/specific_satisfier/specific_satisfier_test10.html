To represent a 2D object in 5D space, there are 3 equations that need to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_0, ..., A_{4})\]
in 5D space lies on the 2D object defined by the point(s)
 \[(\alpha_{0,0},...,\alpha_{0,4}), ..., (\alpha_{2,0},...,\alpha_{2,4})\] which all lie on that 2D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[-80.0000000000000
= 0\]
<br>Equation 2 to be satisfied:
\[-664.000000000000
= 0\]
<br>Equation 3 to be satisfied:
\[-142.000000000000
= 0\]
