To represent a 2D object in 8D space, there are 6 equations that need to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_0, ..., A_{7})\]
in 8D space lies on the 2D object defined by the point(s)
 \[(\alpha_{0,0},...,\alpha_{0,7}), ..., (\alpha_{2,0},...,\alpha_{2,7})\] which all lie on that 2D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 2 to be satisfied:
\[0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 3 to be satisfied:
\[0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 4 to be satisfied:
\[0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 5 to be satisfied:
\[0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 6 to be satisfied:
\[0
= 0\]
