To represent a 1D object in 7D space, there are 6 equations that need to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_0, ..., A_{6})\]
in 7D space lies on the 1D object defined by the point(s)
\[(\alpha_{0,0},...,\alpha_{0,6}), (\alpha_{1,0},...,\alpha_{1,6}) \] which all lie on that 1D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[112.000000000000
= 0\]
<br>Equation 2 to be satisfied:
\[-4.00000000000000
= 0\]
<br>Equation 3 to be satisfied:
\[-44.0000000000000
= 0\]
<br>Equation 4 to be satisfied:
\[-12.0000000000000
= 0\]
<br>Equation 5 to be satisfied:
\[-312.000000000000
= 0\]
<br>Equation 6 to be satisfied:
\[0
= 0\]
