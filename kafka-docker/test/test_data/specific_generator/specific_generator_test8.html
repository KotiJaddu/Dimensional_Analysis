To represent a 2D object in 7D space, there are 5 equations that need to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_0, ..., A_{6})\]
in 7D space lies on the 2D object defined by the point(s)
 \[(\alpha_{0,0},...,\alpha_{0,6}), ..., (\alpha_{2,0},...,\alpha_{2,6})\] which all lie on that 2D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[-84.0*A_1 - 112.0*A_2 + 420.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 2 to be satisfied:
\[3.0*A_1 + 4.0*A_2 - 15.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 3 to be satisfied:
\[33.0*A_1 + 44.0*A_2 - 165.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 4 to be satisfied:
\[9.0*A_1 + 12.0*A_2 - 45.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 5 to be satisfied:
\[234.0*A_1 + 312.0*A_2 - 1170.0
= 0\]
