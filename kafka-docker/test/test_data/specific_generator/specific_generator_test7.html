To represent a 2D object in 6D space, there are 4 equations that need to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_0, ..., A_{5})\]
in 6D space lies on the 2D object defined by the point(s)
 \[(\alpha_{0,0},...,\alpha_{0,5}), ..., (\alpha_{2,0},...,\alpha_{2,5})\] which all lie on that 2D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[-84.0*A_1 - 112.0*A_2 + 420.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 2 to be satisfied:
\[-21.0*A_1 - 28.0*A_2 + 105.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 3 to be satisfied:
\[27.0*A_1 + 36.0*A_2 - 135.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 4 to be satisfied:
\[-3.0*A_1 - 4.0*A_2 + 15.0
= 0\]
