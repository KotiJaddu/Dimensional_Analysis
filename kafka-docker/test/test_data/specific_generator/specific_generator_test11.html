To represent a 1D object in 3D space, there are 2 equations that need to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2})\]
in 3D space lies on the 1D object defined by the point(s)
\[(\alpha_{0,0}, \alpha_{0,1}, \alpha_{0,2}), (\alpha_{1,0}, \alpha_{1,1}, \alpha_{1,2})\] which all lie on that 1D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[4.0*A_0 - 2.0*A_1 - 8.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 2 to be satisfied:
\[-6.0*A_1 + 4.0*A_2 + 8.0
= 0\]
