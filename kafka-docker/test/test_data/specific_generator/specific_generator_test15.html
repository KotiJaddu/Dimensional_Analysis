To represent a 1D object in 5D space, there are 4 equations that need to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_0, ..., A_{4})\]
in 5D space lies on the 1D object defined by the point(s)
\[(\alpha_{0,0},...,\alpha_{0,4}), (\alpha_{1,0},...,\alpha_{1,4}) \] which all lie on that 1D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[2.0*A_0 - 1.0*A_1
= 0\]
<br>Equation 2 to be satisfied:
\[-3.0*A_1 + 2.0*A_4 - 4.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 3 to be satisfied:
\[-1.0*A_1 + 2.0*A_3 - 6.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 4 to be satisfied:
\[1.0*A_1 + 2.0*A_2 - 8.0
= 0\]
