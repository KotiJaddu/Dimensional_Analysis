To represent a 0D object in 12D space, there are 12 equations that need to be satisfied in order to check whether the point
\[(A_0, ..., A_{11})\]
in 12D space lies on the 0D object defined by the point(s)
 \[(\alpha_{0,0},...,\alpha_{0,11}), ..., (\alpha_{0,0},...,\alpha_{0,11})\] which all lie on that 0D object.<br><br>
Equation 1 to be satisfied:
\[A_0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 2 to be satisfied:
\[A_11 - 3.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 3 to be satisfied:
\[A_10 - 4.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 4 to be satisfied:
\[A_9 - 5.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 5 to be satisfied:
\[A_8 - 2.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 6 to be satisfied:
\[A_7 - 2.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 7 to be satisfied:
\[A_6 - 3.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 8 to be satisfied:
\[A_5 - 5.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 9 to be satisfied:
\[A_4 - 4.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 10 to be satisfied:
\[A_3 - 3.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 11 to be satisfied:
\[A_2 - 2.0
= 0\]
<br>Equation 12 to be satisfied:
\[A_1 - 1.0
= 0\]
